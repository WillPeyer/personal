            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                related to the project itself.</p>

            <h2>Harmonize - CS 309 Team Project</h2>
            <p>As part of a semester-long project in CS 309, I contributed to the development of an innovative social
                networking application designed to connect users based on their musical preferences. Our team's efforts
                were recognized with a second-place finish among approximately 50 competing groups.</p>

            <h3>My Role and Contributions</h3>
            <p>I took primary responsibility for a significant portion of the frontend development, utilizing Java for
                programming and XML for page markup. Key features I implemented include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Live activity feed</li>
                <li>Friend management system (add/remove functionality)</li>
                <li>Song search capability, leveraging the Spotify API</li>
                <li>Personal music library management (add/remove songs from liked list)</li>
                <li>Song snippet playback feature for recommended songs on the home feed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Skills Acquired</h3>
            <p>This project significantly enhanced my technical skillset, providing hands-on experience with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)</li>
                <li>JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)</li>
                <li>WebSocket technology</li>
                <li>Comprehensive software development lifecycle</li>
                <li>Agile methodologies and team collaboration</li>
                <li>Integration with third-party APIs (Spotify)</li>
                <li>Audio playback implementation in mobile applications</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Outcome and Reflection</h3>
            <p>Our app's success in the class competition underscores the effectiveness of our collaborative efforts and
                the quality of our implementation. The integration of the Spotify API and the song snippet feature not
                only enhanced the user experience but also provided valuable insights into working with external
                services and handling media playback. This project not only honed my technical skills but also
                emphasized the critical importance of cohesive teamwork in software development. I take great pride in
                our collective achievement and the valuable learning experience it provided.</p>
